## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment & Rollback Plan

### Potential Risks

<!-- What could go wrong? What are the failure modes? -->

1. **Database Schema Changes**: 
   - Risk: Data migration issues
   - Mitigation: Test migrations in staging first

2. **API Breaking Changes**:
   - Risk: Frontend compatibility issues
   - Mitigation: Version API endpoints

3. **Performance Impact**:
   - Risk: Slower response times
   - Mitigation: Performance testing in staging

### Rollback Plan

<!-- How to quickly rollback if issues are detected -->

1. **Immediate Rollback** (if critical issues):
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous commit
   git revert HEAD
   npm run deploy:production
   ```

2. **Database Rollback** (if schema issues):
   ```bash
   # Restore from backup
   npm run db:restore:production
   ```

3. **Service Rollback** (if runtime issues):
   ```bash
   # Deploy previous version
   npm run rollback:production
   ```

### Monitoring Points

<!-- What to watch after deployment -->

- [ ] **Error Rate**: < 1% for all endpoints
- [ ] **Response Time**: < 100ms average
- [ ] **Function Execution**: < 500ms cold start
- [ ] **Database Performance**: < 50ms query time
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: < 80% of allocated
